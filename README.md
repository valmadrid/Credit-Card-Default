# Module 5 Final Project


## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 5.

Wherever we don't specify something you can fall back on the Mod4_Project specifications.

You will be able to book a feedback session for your team's project before the final delivery of your presentation where we will focus on a particular area you would like support with.

## Final Project Summary

Congratulations! You've made it through another _intense_ module, and now you're ready to show off your newfound Machine Learning skills!

All that remains for Module 5 is to complete the final project!

## The Project

For this project, you'll then use everything you've learned about Data Science and Machine Learning thus far to source a dataset, preprocess and explore it, and then build and interpret a classification model that answers your chosen question.
Model comparison and human reasoning are expected.

## The data

We will be working with the **Credit card Default UCI Dataset** trying to predict whether someone won't pay their credit card debt the following month.
Find the documentation and data [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

## The Deliverables

For online students, your completed project should contain the following four deliverables:

1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.

2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository and be an Executive Summary of your findings.

3. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that gives a brief overview of your problem/dataset, and each step of the OSEMN process.

Note: On-campus students may have different deliverables, please speak with your instructor.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation. Functions live in properly named .py files
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  

**_Process, Methodology, and Findings_**

* Your notebook should contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results.
* We recommend you use the OSEMN process to help organize your thoughts and stay on track.
* Don't forget to add a summary of this to your README.dm

## Grading Rubric
